Hi! My name is Noah Lochbaum. I am a fifth grader living in San Mateo, California. I created this website to help educate people on how to grow plants and other gardening techniques. My goal is to help reduce air pollution by increasing the number of plants in the world! This website is going to teach you more about diffferent kinds of plants and how to take care of them. The website is divided into sections based on different groups of plants.
